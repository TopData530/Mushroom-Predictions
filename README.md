# Mushroom-Predictions
### These visualizations starts off by showing the populations of all the mushrooms in the dataset. Then we take the population and seperate it by which population groups are poisonous and which ones are edible. The pie charts on the second image displays the groupings of their population by percantage. The last image is the most important because it displays which percantage of mushrooms are edible or poisonous by their odor and we can see 81% of edible mushrooms have no smell but only 3% of poisonous mushrooms have a smell. However, the poisonous mushrooms all have an odor to them and 55% of them have a foul smell.

## Final Model Evauluation
### The best model to be used from my notebook is the decision tree model tuned with grid search. This model is great because it has the fastest performance when compared to all the other models and retained a perfect accuracy. This is important because in the confusion matrix display, we can see there are no false negatives or any false positives. The false negatives can be dangerous because it mistakes poisonous mushrooms as edible, but with this model there are no need to worry.

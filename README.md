## Final Model Evauluation
### The best model to be used is the knn model with the pca, because this model gives high accuracy and speed if needed because it's variance components has been reduced to 95% for increased speed and did not sacrafice the accuracy. This model would be good to use when predicting but since the accuracy is perfect even when reducing variance, there could be some discrepencies. In this case we could choose the random forest regressor as a great choice too, because the data did not have to be converted which saves time too.

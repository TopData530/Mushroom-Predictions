# Mushroom Edibility
### These explanatory visualizations are here to inform you of which mushrooms are poisonous and which are edible and how to spot them by odor and the patterns in their population. We start by showing the populations of all the mushrooms in the dataset.The pie charts in the second image display the groupings of edibility by their population by percentage. The third image displays which mushrooms are poisonous or edible by odor.
## Visualization of mushroom population
This pie chart shows the population of all the mushrooms in this dataset and half the set has a several populations.

## Visualization of poisonous or edible mushrooms by population
These two charts represent the populations of both edible and poisonous which are displayed by name of population. The edible ones are more evenly dispersed but 72% of the poisonous mushrooms are scattered. This means its best to avoid scattered mushrooms as they have a more likely hood of being poisonous.

## Visualization of poisonous or edible mushrooms by their odor
These two charts displays which percantage of mushrooms are edible or poisonous by their odor and we can see 81% of edible mushrooms have no smell but only 3% of poisonous mushrooms have a smell. However, the poisonous mushrooms all have an odor to them and 55% of them have a foul smell which means your safer avoiding mushrooms with bad odor.

## Final model evauluation
### The best model to be used from my notebook is the decision tree model tuned with grid search. This model is great because it has the fastest performance when compared to all the other models and retained a perfect accuracy. This is important because in the confusion matrix display, which I have included image below and we can see there are no false negatives or any false positives. The false negatives can be dangerous because it mistakes poisonous mushrooms as edible. This image shows that there are 1040 edible mushrooms and 991 poisonous mushrooms in this data set with none being falsely categorized.

## Final recommendations
### The best way to look forward is to understand that most poisonous mushrooms are scattered and have a foul smell, so it's best to avoid these if looking for mushrooms to eat. Image three shows that only 3% of poisonous mushrooms have no scent, and image two tells us that solitary populations and several have no poisonous mushrooms. Using the information from the odor combined with population is the best and safest approach to finding edible mushrooms.
